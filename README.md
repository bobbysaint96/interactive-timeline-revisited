# interactive-timeline-revisited
Click the years at the bottom to observe different years, click on the countries to get linked out to articles related to the countries during the time period!

Current issues - only have images up until BCE 500, screen resizing doesn't adjust interactive elements when resized via the fullscreen button in the browser. Clicking and dragging the image to different sizes doesn't create this issue (I believe this is an issue within the p5.js library)

Images created and modified using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, civilization data based on information on timemaps.com, original map file from worldmap.harvard.edu
